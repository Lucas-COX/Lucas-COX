## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas Cox, I am currently studying at Epitech IT in Lyon.

### My work :

:sweat_smile: I do not have much work to show you except some of my school projects, but I'd love to collaborate and get some more projects to show !\
:computer: I am really interested in web and functional technologies. Even if those two differ completely, both interest me equally.\
:handshake: Do not hesitate to reach me if you need a collaborator on a project that uses one of those technologies !
